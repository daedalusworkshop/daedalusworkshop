# Daedalus
In Greek Mythology, Daedalus was the greatest architect and craftman, seen as a symbol of wisdom, power, and knowledge. He created the labyrinth, home of the Minotaur. 
### Flying too close to the sun
When he helped Theseus kill the Minotaur; him and his son, Icarus, were imprisoned. To escape, Daedalus made wings. But he warned Icarus that if he went too close to the sun, the wax glueing the wings together would cause the wings to break. Icarus forgot about this and flew too close to the sun. For centuries, this idiom had been used.
