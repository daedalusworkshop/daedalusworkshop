# Daedalus
In Greek Mythology, Daedalus was the greatest architect and craftman, seen as a symbol of wisdom, power, and knowledge. He created the labyrinth, home of the Minotaur. 
### Flying too close to the sun
When he helped Theseus kill the Minotaur; him and his son, Icarus, were imprisoned. To escape, Daedalus made wings. But he warned Icarus that if he went too close to the sun, the wax glueing the wings together would cause the wings to break. Icarus forgot about this and flew too close to the sun. For centuries, this idiom had been used.

While I'm precocious, I shares more qualaties with Icarus than Daedalus. As I'm 15, fly using the wings of my mentors, and I have a propensity to go to extremes which can lead to flying too close to the sun.

I've named myself Daedalus because I believe in [joke about the results you want to see](https://twitter.com/visakanv/status/1394772091660951555?s=20&t=jlzQ4HJ-XbXcD6JIRQegiQ) and I hope that someday in the cloudy depths of the future, I can make wings to save us from the prision of "modern" day computers.

Enough [anti-marketing](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4bK6LaSBRetDzuYkeCs3A8mJ8DufTbK4o6FS), I'm interested in (mostly) everything. Here's some coding spirits I dance with:

Coding as a force for good, shamanic coding, open-source, creating gifts for cyberspace friends, what would Daedalus do?, digital hellenistic offerings, Linux, Manjaro Linux, customizing your home in the cyberspace.
